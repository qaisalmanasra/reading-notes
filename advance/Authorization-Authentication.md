# Auth Module Final Project
#### Create a new application using your API Server and Authentication System



## Requirements
#### Must employ the following programming concepts:

1. API/Auth server must be deployed
2. Use of your API server to perform database operations
3. Use of login/auth/acl to control access to your resources
## Presentation
#### On the due-date, the team will present a working version of the project to the class showcasing the following:

* General Functionality
* Wiring (quick overview)
* Code Review
Plan for ~15 minutes for your teamâ€™s presentation

## Project Ideas
* A command line application that prompts a user to:
  * Create an account with a password
  * Login with an account
  * Edit account details
  * Delete an account
  * Look into node modules such as Inquirer for inspiration
* A clone of Postman or HTTPIE that can run requests against your API easily and shows the results
* A command line application that lets you enter a note (a sentence) and stores it to a database, and later get a list of your notes

### I suggest to work with the team in a command line application that make us implement all the things that we have learnt.
